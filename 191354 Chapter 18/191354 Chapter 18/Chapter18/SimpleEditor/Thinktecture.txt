We have specialized in helping developers and architects create distributed applications which perform and scale as necessary. Our clients work in some of the most challenging environments of software development today.

We have recognized in the past that a short period - maybe only a few days - of additional support, training or reviewing in the early phases of a project can make a big difference for its success. In the past five years we have helped a number of different projects to start quicker and to avoid critical problems right from the start.
