      This class allows you to factorize a number according to certain rules.

      <summary>
      Gets the factors of a number.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
      This method is used to obtain the factors of a number, that is, all the numbers that the number can be divided by without leaving a remainder.
      If IncludeOne and IncludeSelf are both true and the result returned consists of exactly two numbers (the number itself and one) then the number is prime.

      Include 1 in GetFactors() result.
